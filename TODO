How will I load the css from the themes into this?

### Overall

Add type hints for camera types
Try aspecto with other screens (Is there a need to adapt it to small screens?)
REview CSS (there are some place where the px measure might need to be switched to percentages)
Add rounded edges for all the cards
Make Sure I pass hass for all the elements (? might not be necessary but it good practice)
When I click +camera it take a while for the first dialog to appear. Why?
On dialog if I press 'esc' I can not reopen the dialogs

### In main

- The search bar can be used to search for more stuff in the camera information (disccus at the end)
- There is a weird flicker in the main menu due to bar on the left appearing and disapearing when I turn on the timer

## In raceland camera card

- The menu is supposed to appear at the top. Center the text in the div (the css does not seem to be working)
- the pointer css propetry is useless?

## In the select brand dialog

- Fetch local items
- Dinamic text size with css depending on the lenght?

## In the new-camera-card

- Also highligh text upon hover

## In open model dialog

- Fail safe when there is not models for that camera brand in the databse

## In formulary

- Close button does not work on the formulary dialog for some reason
- Integration type -> Use SVG icon in before the selector
- Icons in record Video of camera and more options are not appearing
- Advanced Options for custom camera
