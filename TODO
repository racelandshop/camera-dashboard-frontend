How will I load the css from the themes into this?

### Overall

Add type hints for camera types
Fix aspect ration with other screens size (Is there a need to adapt it to small screens?)
Review CSS (there are some place where the px measure might need to be switched to percentages)
Add rounded edges for all the cards
Make Sure I pass hass for all the elements (? might not be necessary but it good practice)
When I click +camera it take a while for the first dialog to appear. Why?

DO/Verify translations. Duplicated keys in translation

### In main

- The search bar can be used to search for more stuff in the camera information (disccus at the end)
- There is a weird flicker in the main menu due to bar on the left appearing and disapearing when I turn on the timer

## In raceland camera card

- The menu is supposed to appear at the top. Center the text in the div (the css does not seem to be working)
- the pointer css propetry is useless?

## In the select brand dialog

- Fetch local items (images)
- Dinamic text size with css depending on the lenght?

## In formulary

- In the autocomplete camera form (when picking one camera model, add information about the default 'door' i.e what comes after ":" . Also, if the IP has a 'door' ignore this parameter. (where do I find information about this?)
- Currently, when the channel name is null I can not add stuff (see this error in the formulary validInput methods)

## In the edit camera info dialog:

- Need to update/improve the CSS
