How will I load the css from the themes into this?

### Overall

Add type hints for camera types
Try aspecto with other screens (Is there a need to adapt it to small screens?)
Review the the fire-events
Review CSS (there are some place where the px measure might need to be switched to percentages)
Add rounded edges for all the cards
Make Sure I pass hass for all the elements (? might not be necessary but it good practice)
When I click +camera it take a while for the first dialog to appear. Why?
Rework the entire HACS object into a raceland object. I will need this for updating

DO/Verify translations. Duplicated keys in translation

I also have to be carefull to update the frontned information when If the entity Id is updated

In the advanced options toogle I can implement it in another (check enery dashboard)

### In main

- The search bar can be used to search for more stuff in the camera information (disccus at the end)
- There is a weird flicker in the main menu due to bar on the left appearing and disapearing when I turn on the timer

## In raceland camera card

- The menu is supposed to appear at the top. Center the text in the div (the css does not seem to be working)
- the pointer css propetry is useless?

## In the select brand dialog

- Fetch local items (images)
- Dinamic text size with css depending on the lenght?

## In the new-camera-card

- Also highligh text upon hover

## In open model dialog

- Fail safe when there is not models for that camera brand in the databse

## In formulary

- Integration type -> Use SVG icon in before the selector
- Icons in record Video of camera and more options are not appearing
- In the autocomplete camera form (when picking one camera model, add information about the default 'door' i.e what comes after ":" . Also, if the IP has a 'door' ignore this parameter.
- I can not add a camera if there are advanced options. Why?

## In the edit camera info dialog:

- Need to update/improve the CSS
